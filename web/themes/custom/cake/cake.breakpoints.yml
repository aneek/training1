# Cake theme breakpoints file.

# What is breakpoint in Drupal?
# Drupal 8 and above, has mobile first design approach so responsiveness is out of the box. Due to this, it was
# really important that Drupal must provide a way to implement and expose different types of media queries along with
# different viewport configurations. This is the reason that breakpoints.yml file was introduced.

# Where we can define this?
# Either a module or a theme can provide breakpoint configurations. Remember, there is no UI to implement this.
# Naming convention of this file should be <module_name OR theme_name>.breakpoints.yml

# What are the properties of this file?
# Each entry in this file defines one breakpoint, consisting of a machine name, by which the breakpoint entry is
# uniquely identified e.g. bartik.mobile, and its children defining the breakpoint's properties:
# 1. label - A human readable label for the breakpoint.
# 2. mediaQuery - Media query text proper, e.g. 'all and (min-width: 851px)'.
# 3. weight - Positional weight (order) for the breakpoint.
# 4. multipliers - Supported pixel resolution multipliers. (say, for Retina display)
